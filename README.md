## Technologies

* Tone.js
    * Tone.js synchronizes the playback of audio to a consistent rhythm. It also allows the programming of various audio effects which can be coupled with     synthesizers or audio file playback
<br></br>

* Fl Studio
   * Fl Studio is an audio mixing and composition program. The samples used in the drum machine were taken from various drum libraries. Fl Studio's amplitude automation software and equalization plugins were used to optimize the audio files for play together.

## Features

* 8 track drum kit
    * Features 8 custom sounds, sampled then mixed in FL Studio.

* Tempo automation knobs
    * Tone.js' synchronization feature is harnessed to allow the user to set the exact BPM (beats per minute) of the drum track, allowing the playing of multiple genres of music.
    * The "Swing" knob allows the offbeat notes to be played slightly off sync to add a funky, more organic rhythm to the playback.

* Effects knobs
    * The effects knobs automate the output of the drum machine with classic effects including delay, distortion, and lowpass.
